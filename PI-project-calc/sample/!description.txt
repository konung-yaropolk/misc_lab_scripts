	DRS pattern #1:

		A-stim means: 50us +100uA
		C-stim means: 1ms  -150uA
		100ms Lag betwin A and C stim when they appears simultaneously in the step

		Each step:  10s
		Each epoch: 6 steps = 60s
		Epoch count: 10

		Epoch by steps layout:
		  _ _ _ _ _ _ 
		A|x| |x| |x| |
		C| |x| | |x| |

		
		Stimulators settings (two A-M systems 2100):

	        	A-stim: delay     0; burst_width 601s; pulse_duration 0.05ms; interpulse_period 20s
	        	C-stim: delay 10.1s; burst_width 601s; pulse_duration 1   ms; interpulse_period 30s

	Drug Application trig: changed to ASP 7663           50uM tube (no recyculation)   # Big responce
	Wash out

	Drug Application trig: changed to CIM 0216           50uM tube (no recyculation)   # Big responce
	Wash out

	Drug Application: added Capsaicin(100nM) directly into the tube   # Big responce










	Drugs disolving:

ASP 7663     apply at 50 uM for 5 min (50 mM stock in DMSO) - disolve 1k times
CIM 0216     apply at 50 uM for 5 min (50 mM stock in DMSO) - disolve 1k times
BTD          apply at 50 uM for 5 min (50 mM stock in DMSO) - disolve 1k times

Capsaicin    apply at 100nM for 5 min (1mM   stock)         - disolve 10k times





	Summary: there wasn't postsynaptic fluorescense
